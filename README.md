# Image-Processing
image processing using matlab

1. Edge detection. An image is nothing but mapping of intensity of the light reflecting from a scene captured from a camera, and edges are the discontinuity of the scene intensity function. We can detect these edges using MATLAB commands.There are many methods for edge detection such as Robertâ€™s operator, Prewitt operator, Sobel operator, Canny edge detector and so on. 

2. Noise. Noise in any system is unwanted. In image processing, noise in a digital image arises during image acquisition and also during transmission. Different types of noise include speckle, Gaussian, salt-and-pepper and more.
